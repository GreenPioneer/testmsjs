**Note:** There is no preference how you name or structure your views.
You could place all your templates in a top-level `views` directory without
having a nested folder structure, if that makes things easier for you.
Just don't forget to update `extends ../layout`  and corresponding
`res.render()` paths in controllers.

JavaScript Standard Style
-------------
- **2 spaces** – for indentation
- **Single quotes for strings** – except to avoid escaping
- **No unused variables** – this one catches *tons* of bugs!
- **No semicolons** – [It's][1] [fine.][2] [Really!][3]
- **Never start a line with `(` or `[`**
  - This is the **only** gotcha with omitting semicolons – *automatically checked for you!*
  - [More details][4]
- **Space after keywords** `if (condition) { ... }`
- **Space after function name** `function name (arg) { ... }`
- Always use `===` instead of `==` – but `obj == null` is allowed to check `null || undefined`.
- Always handle the node.js `err` function parameter
- Always prefix browser globals with `window` – except `document` and `navigator` are okay
  - Prevents accidental use of poorly-named browser globals like `open`, `length`,
    `event`, and `name`.
- **And [more goodness][5]** – *give `standard` a try today!*

[the repositories](https://github.com/feross/standard-packages/blob/master/standard.json) that use
`standard`.

few minor exceptions. 

### Reporting an Issue
1. Please make sure that there is not an issue already open
2. If that's the case, then add your observations in that same issue
3. If your issue is unique, add following details in the issue
  - OS name and version
  - NodeJS and NPM version : Output of `node -v` and `npm -v`
  - MEAN Status : Output of `mean status` in project directory
  - Tracelog : The error that got printed on the console
  - Any other relevant details
4. Add `[Feature]` in the title if its a suggestion rather than an issue that you would like to see in MEAN.

**Note:** If you are new to Node or Express, I recommend to watch
[Node.js and Express 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0JlMZCtNU)
screencast by Alex Ford that teaches Node and Express from scratch. Alternatively,
here is another great tutorial for complete beginners - [Getting Started With Node.js, Express, MongoDB](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/).

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter.git myproject

# Change directory
cd myproject

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

node index.js
```

**Note:** I highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run
`sudo npm install -g nodemon`.

Pro Tips
--------

- When installing an NPM package, add a *--save* flag, and it will be automatically
added to `package.json` as well. For example, `npm install --save moment`.
- Use [async.parallel()](https://github.com/caolan/async#parallel) when you need to run multiple
asynchronous tasks, and then render a page, but only when all tasks are completed. For example, you might
want to scrape 3 different websites for some data and render the results in a template
after all 3 websites have been scraped.
- Need to find a specific object inside an Array? Use [_.find](http://lodash.com/docs#find)
function from Lodash. For example, this is how you would retrieve a
Twitter token from database: `var token = _.find(req.user.tokens, { kind: 'twitter' });`,
where 1st parameter is an array, and a 2nd parameter is an object to search for.

FAQ
---

### Why do I get `403 Error: Forbidden` when submitting a form?
You need to add the following hidden input element to your form. This has been
added in the [pull request #40](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter/pull/40)
as part of the CSRF protection.

```
input(type='hidden', name='_csrf', value=_csrf)
```

**Note:** It is now possible to whitelist certain URLs. In other words you can
specify a list of routes that should bypass CSRF verification check.

**Note 2:** To whitelist dynamic URLs use regular expression tests inside the
CSRF middleware to see if `req.originalUrl` matches your desired pattern.

### What is cluster_app.js?

**Note**: It is now part of the generator as of **v2.1**.

From the [Node.js Documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html#cluster_how_it_works):
> A single instance of Node runs in a single thread. To take advantage of multi-core systems
> the user will sometimes want to launch a cluster of Node processes to handle the load.
> The cluster module allows you to easily create child processes that all share server ports.

Running `cluster_app.js` allows you to take advantage of this feature by forking
a process of `app.js` for each detected CPU. For the majority of applications
serving HTTP requests, this is a nice benefit. However, the cluster module is
still in experimental stage, therefore it should only be used after understanding
its purpose and behavior. To use it, simply run `node cluster_app.js`.
**Its use is entirely optional and `app.js` is not tied in any way to it**.
As a reminder, if you plan to use `cluster_app.js` instead of `app.js`,
be sure to indicate that in `package.json` when you are ready to deploy your app.

### I am getting MongoDB Connection Error, how do I fix it?
That's a custom error message defined in `app.js` to indicate that there was a
problem connecting to MongoDB:

```js
mongoose.connection.on('error', function() {
  console.error('�? MongoDB Connection Error. Please make sure MongoDB is running.');
});
```
You need to have a MongoDB server running before launching `app.js`. You can
download MongoDB [here](mongodb.org/downloads), or install it via a package manager.

Windows users, read [Install MongoDB on Windows](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/).

**Tip:** If you are always connected to the internet, you could just use
[MongoLab](https://mongolab.com/) or [Compose](https://www.compose.io/) instead
of downloading and installing MongoDB locally. You will only need to update the
`db` property in `config/secrets.js`.

### I get an error when I deploy my app, why?
Chances are you haven't changed the *Database URI* in `secrets.js`. If `db` is
set to `localhost`, it will only work on your machine as long as MongoDB is
running. When you deploy to Heroku, OpenShift or some other provider, you will not have MongoDB
running on `localhost`. You need to create an account with [MongoLab](https://mongolab.com/)
or [Compose](https://www.compose.io/), then create a free tier database.
See [Deployment](#deployment) for more information on how to setup an account
and a new database step-by-step with MongoLab.

### Why Jade instead of Handlebars?


**Step 1.** Start by defining a route.
```js
app.get('/books', bookController.getBooks);
```

---

**Note:** As of Express 4.x you can define you routes like so:

```js
app.route('/books')
  .get(bookController.getBooks)
  .post(bookController.createBooks)
  .put(bookController.updateBooks)
  .delete(bookController.deleteBooks)
```

And here is how a route would look if it required an *authentication* and an *authorization* middleware:

```js
app.route('/api/twitter')
  .all(passportConf.isAuthenticated)
  .all(passportConf.isAuthorized)
  .get(apiController.getTwitter);
  .post(apiController.postTwitter)
```

Use whichever style that makes sense to you. Either one is acceptable. I really think that chaining HTTP verbs on
`app.route` is very clean and elegant approach, but on the other hand I can no longer see all my routes at a glance
when you have one route per line.

**Step 2.** Create a new schema and a model `Book.js` inside the *models* directory.
```js
var bookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String
});

var Book = mongoose.model('Book', bookSchema);
module.exports = Book;
```

**Step 3.** Create a new controller file called `book.js` inside the *controllers* directory.
```js
/**
 * GET /books
 * List all books.
 */
var Book = require('../models/Book.js');

exports.getBooks = function(req, res) {
  Book.find(function(err, docs) {
    res.render('books', { books: docs });
  });
};
```

**Step 4.** Import that controller in `app.js`.
```js
var bookController = require('./controllers/book');
```

**Step 5.** Create `books.jade` template.
```jade
extends layout

block content
  .page-header
    h3 All Books

  ul
    for book in books
      li= book.name
```

That's it! I will say that you could have combined Step 1, 2, 3 as following:

```js
app.get('/books', function(req, res) {
  Book.find(function(err, docs) {
    res.render('books', { books: docs });
  });
});
```

Sure, it's simpler, but as soon as you pass 1000 lines of code in `app.js` it becomes a little difficult to navigate the file.
I mean, the whole point of this boilerplate project was to separate concerns, so you could
work with your teammates without running into *MERGE CONFLICTS*. Imagine you have 4 developers
working on a single `app.js`, I promise you it won't be fun resolving merge conflicts all the time.
If you are the only developer then it's fine. But as I said, once it gets up to a certain LoC size, it becomes
difficult to maintain everything in a single file.

That's all there is to it. Express.js is super simple to use.
Most of the time you will be dealing with other APIs to do the real work:
[Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) for querying database, socket.io for sending and receiving messages over websockets,
sending emails via [Nodemailer](http://nodemailer.com/), form validation using [express-validator](https://github.com/ctavan/express-validator) library,
parsing websites using [Cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio), and etc.

#### Find all users:
```js
User.find(function(err, users) {
  console.log(users);
});
```

#### Find a user by email:
```js
var userEmail = 'example@gmail.com';
User.findOne({ email: userEmail }, function(err, user) {
  console.log(user);
});
```

#### Find 5 most recent user accounts:
```js
User
  .find()
  .sort({ _id: -1 })
  .limit(5)
  .exec(function(err, users) {
    console.log(users);
  });
```

#### Get total count of a field from all documents:
Let's suppose that each user has a `votes` field and you would like to count
the total number of votes in your database across all users. One very
inefficient way would be to loop through each document and manually accumulate
the count. Or you could use [MongoDB Aggregation Framework](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/aggregation-introduction/) instead:

```js
User.aggregate({ $group: { _id: null, total: { $sum: '$votes' } } }, function(err, votesCount) {
  console.log(votesCount.total);
});
```
