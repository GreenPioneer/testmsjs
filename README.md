INFO _ THIS IS NOT THE LIVE REPO

ONCE AGAIN NOT THE LIVE REPO

We are building in this framework to make your life as a designer or developer easier. We believe in making this framework usable for User Experience Designers, Quality Assurance Engineers, Software Engineers, Frontend & Backend Developers & Full Stack Engineers... etc. Were doing this by having key features in the framework we like we listed below:

- Customizable CLI for scaffolding of modules
- Can Build Dynamic Api's based off Schema
- Can Open Dynamic Query with routes
- LiveReload & Recompile in Development Env
- Not Dependent on Grunt or Gulp 
- No Magic Wand
- Uses JS Standard & John Papa Angular Style
- UI framework agnostic - Use Boostrap , Materialize or Foundation
- Supports CSS, SCSS & LESS
- Simple Project Structure
- Supports Clustering
- Supports Environments: Development, Test & Production

Those are just some of the reasons why we believe using mean stack js will help you in your development. What we want to do moving forward with this project is to layout a road map so that you can give your thoughts and let us know what we can add to make your life easier with this framework. We welcome all of those who wish to contribute and be apart of this. Join us in building and using the newest style in mean stacks
